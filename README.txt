Project name: Mission Impossible

Project Description: In this 2D sniper game, a person with a sniper in a specific location shoots monsters. Character can move rightward/leftward by pressing "D" and "A". There are two stages for generating monsters. There are 3 kinds of monsters with various movements and health. Monster 1: walks toward the baseline, and only has contact damage. Monster 2: avoids bullets + will attack per 5 seconds. Monster 3: higher HP, moves toward the perosn when the person is not eqiupping the sniper, attacks per six seconds. For the bullets buff: elemental attack (fire and freeze). Fire means larger attack attribute for the sniper. Meanwhile, it has burn effects that deal additional damage to those monsters. Freeze means monsters are slowed down except the boss. The character also has two skills: shield: If you press "W", then the character would absorb 75 percent of the damage in the following two seconds. (10 seconds cooldown) trackingBullet: if you press "S", then the bullets would automatically track the movement of monsters and trace those monsters for 7 seconds. (15 seconds cooldown). There is a possibility that after killing enemies, fire, freeze, heal orbs would be dropped, and they can be collected when the character not equipping the sniper. Those buffs last only 30 seconds. There are even some achievement badges to be collected. Maybe try to shoot first 20 bullets without a miss or reach 400/400 health. If you unlock the achievements, you will see those acievements unlocked even if you play this game again. In the second stage, there is a big boss to fight with with 2 states. 1st state: walk towards the sniper stupidly. 2nd stage: turns invicible for some period of time, regenrates 300 HP for itself with a skill of avoiding bullets to a crazy extent, and generates monsters. Also, in the game, there will be a terrain generated on the battlefield (50% of the probability would be stones, 50% for woods). They have different size and health. They can be removed when their HP is zero. Monsters would also avoid colliding with them. But for boss, it will destroy the terrains it steps on. **: This game contains a "AI adaptive difficulty": it considers four factors: time elapsed, amount of monsters in the battlefield, bullets accuracy, and the health the character currectly has. If the composite score of those four with different factors is high, then we can assume you are doing good in this game. Then game would be harder. Monsters have a faster speed with increased attack attribute. Vice versa for the case if you are not doing good in this game. Remember you can click the question mark icon when playing. It has some information & statistics for the game, such as the health of monster 1, the damage of the monster 2, and so on. After killing all the monsters and the boss, you are win! Instead, you lose the game.
